## TALE - Tool for the Annotation of Low-dimensional Embeddings

This is the frontend for TALE, a _T_ool for _A_nnotation of _L_ow-dimensional _E_mbeddings. It offers functionality to assess, interprate and rate low-dimensional projections, such as those generated by e.g. t-SNE or UMAP. See [todo - add paper link](www.arxiv.org) for a more complete description. It is written in Javascript and heavily utilizes [dc.js](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js). 

https://github.com/rmitsch/TALE-backend is required to run in the background. Head over to https://github.com/rmitsch/TALE for build instructions.
